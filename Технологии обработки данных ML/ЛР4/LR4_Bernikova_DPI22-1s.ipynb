I ended up using quite a bit more flour for dusting in order to be able to roll these out â€” the wet dough kept sticking to me, the rolling pin, and occasionally the pizza peel too! My kitchen looked like a bomb had gone off by the time I was done fighting with those ornery little suckers (due, of course, to my lacking as a bread maker, not to the recipe), and my dog was looking at me like I was completely out of my tree, lol. All the frustration went out the window as soon as I saw that first perfectly round, beautifully puffed little pita bread in the oven. I can't say much for the appearance of the rest of my pitas, but the flavor and texture made up for the high percentage of uglies I made. The beer gives these a nice tang, and as difficult a time as I had rolling these out, it WAS really nice not having to knead or do multiple rises.

I was feeding 5 people and didn't think 8 ounces would do it. I was glad I did as it all got eaten. Finally, after cooking the shrimp, peppers (I didn't have any fresh peppers so used about 3/4 c roasted red peppers in a jar) and pine nuts, I added the pasta to the skillet, then the wine and shallot mixture. Next time, I'd put the pasta in a bowl, then add the prawn mixture then the wine mixture as in the recipe. It would work better than my method because when I mixed the pasta in the skillet, all the good stuff sunk to the bottom and it was hard to get all the ingredients in one scoop.

When I tasted the sauce before serving I felt it was in dire need of both salt and pepper, so that was also added. No one flavour dominates, both the apple and the mustard flavours are subtle. The next time I make this I will pound the breasts, to thin them down a bit and make them all even. This was a snap to prepare and comes together very quickly.

      "\u001b[31mОшибка в отзыве от пользователя 15718: They say necessity is the mother of invention. I was craving a New York style crumb cake and Tracy K recommended this one to me. To my dismay I discovered I only had olive oil and no milk and did not feel like going shopping. The olive oil would have been too strong a flavored substitue for the canola oil. That forced me to make a few minor changes that worked out just fine. Instead of using canola oil and flour to grease the baking pan, I used butter and flour. The recipe called for 1/2 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of canola oil. I didn't have milk in the house but did have a quart of heavy cream. I used heavy cream in place of the milk and increased the amount from 1/2 to 2/3 as cream is much thicker than milk. I didn't add any oil as the heavy cream's higher fat content took it's place too. The rest of the recipe I followed as written. As a few other reviewers found the batter is a bit thick and not easily spread. Instead of adding anymore liquid as one reviewr had, I lightly sprinkled a bit of flour over the batter in the pan and dusted my hands with the flour as well. This allowed me to easily pat the batter perfectly into place withought it sticking to my hands or changing the battter itself. Almost everyone mentioned needing extra baking time, and I was no exception. It took me a total of 30 minutes rather than the 20 the recipe called for before it was done. The end result was fabulous. The texture of the cake was wonderful and the crumbs were perfect too. I will definitely make this one again :) While over-all I found the cake excellent, the cake part was a bit different than what I buy here locally. I think it should have been more like a pound cake or gold cake consistency. It didn't rise as high and light as the cake part of what I buy. Sort of like expecting a cake and ending up with a something more the consistency of a brownie. I gave it 5 stars anyway as it was good on it's own merit. If I were rating it soley on wehther it was a duplicate of what I buy I would have given it only 4._x000D_\n",

      "\u001b[31mОшибка в отзыве от пользователя 531029: I think this recipe has some potential to be a really good dish.  However, there seems to be some errors within the recipe itself.  For instance, in the list of ingredients, it calls for 2 3/4 teaspoons of sesame oil yet, in the directions, it instructs you to put 1 Tablespoon of sesame oil in the marinade.  Additionally, in item #7 of the directions, it tells you to put the rice wine vinegar in the marinade and does not specify an amount.  So the assumption was that you put all 5 teaspoons in the marinade.  But then later, in item #9, it tells you to put the remaining rice wine vinegar in the sauce.  Unfortunately, I did not catch either of these errors until it was too late.  The end result was that the marinade had way too much sesame oil and rice wine vinegar.  The sauce was OK but certainly did not have a garlic flavor at all.

The addition of a nice roux at the end to make a sauce is a good idea. Instead of getting rid of the fat, I simply used a wand blender to purify the liquid and let it reduce down a bit; the pur&eacute;ed onions absorb the fat. It turned out sweeter than I would have liked on the first go with this method, but you can always add salt as needed.

First, I'm glad I didn't cut the chicken into pieces as it says in the ingredient list, because it's difficult to stuff a cut-up chicken (although I'm sure that's just a typo).  Second, I was worried because all I had was quick-cooking oats, but they were still very dry in spots even though I added another 1/4 cup butter to the skillet and the chicken was in the oven almost two hours.  Luckily, I had also used extra melted butter to baste, so I poured that over the stuffing after removing from the bid and it worked out OK.  But I'm glad I didn't use regular oats!  I also had to cover the roasting pan after 45 minutes, because at that temperature the skin was burned almost beyond saving, even though I basted every 15 minutes.

I've tried a lot of recipes and finally discovered that putting my own spin on another really good recipe resulted in the best Mexican meatball soup ever.<br/><br/>I used the \"Best Albondigas Soup\" recipe posted on food.com by RuizA as a start.  I made a few changes that I think make it even more wonderful than it already was.  First, I used ground pork instead of chorizo sausage to mix in with the ground beef.  Chorizo has such a strong, spicy flavor that it tended to dominate some of the more subtle deliciousness of the mint and other seasonings.  Next, I used minced mint leaves in the meatballs instead of cilantro.  (Save the chopped cilantro to sprinkle over the finished soup along with some chopped onion and fresh lime to squeeze.)  Along with the chopped mint, I also added a seeded and deveined, very finely minced jalapeno to the meatball mixture.  Jalapeno is not really hot as long as you get all of the seeds out of it and it adds a terrific flavor as well.  <br/>I used beef broth instead of chicken and I think it made the broth much richer.  Along with the celery I added a couple of coarsely chopped carrots, 2 or 3 peeled and coarsely chopped potatoes, and increased the zucchini to 2 or 3 medium, coarsely chopped.  Add 1 - 28oz can of tomatoes instead of the 16oz and be sure to include the liquid.  Add a handful of chopped cilantro or fresh spinach to the broth.

Raspberries are delicate, so bought fresh raspberries just before making, and rinsed just before using; if using frozen, would let any excess moisture drain out before using.  Had 1 3/4 cups of excess filling, so would either use deep dish pie plate or would put crushed chocolate wafers at bottom of ramekins or silcone muffin cups and top with remaining filling.  Made abstract design on dessert plate with chocolate before placing wedge of pie on top; that led to a finger-licking finale to get every last drop of the resulting raspberry-chocolate sauce.

I have never used bulk pork sausage in the meat sauce (usually use Italian sausage) but I thought the flavor was quite good. The meat sauce was plenty thick which  helped keep the layers from smooshing out when I sliced it. The five cheeses is what, IMO, sets this one apart from all the rest.

Makes 2 approx 1-1/2 pound loaves and extra dough for 2nd loaf stores well for I'd say up to 5 days.  I never made Challah in my life but memorized from a video a 6-rope braid.  Was thrilled with mine but I need to watch the cracks.  Honey is so expensive so I may use sugar next time or a combo.

In addition, no where in the directions does it say where to add the pudding.  I ended up sifting it with the flour and baking soda.  I was concerned about the lack of salt, but there appears to be enough salt in the pudding to make up for it.  Finally, the amount of chocolate chips was a bit confusing the recipe calls for 3 (108) packages of chocolate chips.  I used 3 - 12 oz packages of semi sweet chocolate chips.  This came to 36 ounces total.  I felt the chocolate chip ratio was perfect.  108 oz of chocolate chips would be 9 - 12 oz packages I don't think that would work._x000D_\n",

I then poured the liquid mixture over into the crockpot. I also seasoned my pork chops with minimal salt and pepper along with some Italian dressing mix. Placed them into the crockpot on top of the potato and onions. Let it cook on HIGH for 4.5 hours basting the pork chops throughout the cooking time.

And it was good - but not really better than Jiffy and a whole lot more trouble.  3 bowls and a mini-chopper (for the corn) later, we had corn muffins (my 9x13 is missing!) that went well with dinner, but created a whole lot more dishes than the already overloaded from Christmas-holidays-filled dishwasher could handle.  Anyway, while it is a fine tasting cornbread; for the effort, cleanup and calories concerned, we were disappointed.  Thanks, tho, Kittencal - I always look at your recipes when they turn up because they are usually winners.  Update on this review: although a lot of effort for a cornbread, the leftovers were rated high by my family, the recipients thereof, so I have added a star to my original review.  On taste alone it is a good recipe and great for a special dinner where cornbread fits in and the effort would be appreciated. | Рейтинг: 4, Рецепт ID: 285773\u001b[0m\n",

I was afraid it would be too sweet, but the garlic/salt of the marinade helped.

      "\u001b[31mОшибка в отзыве от пользователя 2001281909: Not bad, but Paprika is ubiquitous, so why not use it? It comes it both hot and sweet varieties if you buy the Hungarian ones in supermarkets. If you want the perfect sausage for this dish, look for Bende Kolbasz. It is sold directly from Bende, but also available though several local and online Hungarian deli's. The deli I use is in Florida and mails things in styrofoam containers with cold packs to keep things cold. But there are many other options, and using a deli allows you to buy other ingredients that may be hard to find in a supermarket. I don't peel the tomatoes, but if you don't, you have to cut the tomatoes into much smaller pieces or you get wads of chewy tomato skins. It's just unpleasant that way. I also use about equal portions of tomatoes and peppers, and about half as much onions, so the ratio is 2:2:1, tomato, peppers, onions. The way I make it at home is with about a cup or two of rice added (depends on how much I made), and add kolbasz to taste. When I don't have kolbasz, Cajun sausages will do nearly as well (andhuille?). I also add lots of crushed garlic at the end of cooking (don't cook it to death or the flavor is gone), and when I'm feeling creative, I add ginger to the onions during the sweat. Ginger is a great addition. Also, don't be sparing with paprika, I add it by tablespoonfuls (the mild). Kashmiri peppers (available dried in Indian specialty stores) are exactly like I remember Paprika in Banat area of modern Romania, it has a mild warming heat, not a choking heat like cayenne. | Рейтинг: 4, Рецепт ID: 47617\u001b[0m\n",

I could just say \"ditto\" to Yogi's review because I, too, put garlic and cayenne in everything, and I forced myself to at least taste this before doing so.  It was perfect just as it was.  While I stuck very close to the recipe, I did do a couple things differently.  First, I substituted baby butter beans for the chickpeas, just because my DH doesn't like chickpeas too well.  Secondly - I made this in a crock pot!  I skipped the oil and did not  saute the onion or ginger, I just dumped everything but the parsley and lemon juice in, turned it on LOW, and went to work.  When I got home 9 hours later, a wonderful aroma greeted me when I opened the door, followed by my husband who whispered, \"I snuck some beans...And they are really good!\"   I put some Jasmine rice on the stove and stirred the lemon juice and parsley (along with a few extra scallions) into the beans, and we were ready.  I was afraid it would get too soupy in the CP, but I guess the long cooking time for the beans thickened and balanced out any extra liquid that might've been released.  Some time when I am just cooking for me, I will make it will the chickpeas (I love them), and I also think this would work out great for a potluck or buffet, especially in the crockpot.

I definitely think that this makes a great shake -- it's thick, creamy, smooth, a little sweet (I used 1% milk and added a couple packets of Truvia to it). Okay, I have to tell you that I was a little afraid of this recipe because I love avocado, but I struggle a bit with it being in a sweet recipe. I think to make myself stop thinking of guacamole while I drink it, I would have to make it sweeter (maybe use the sweetened condensed milk instead), but that's just my own mental block against sweet avocado. It really didn't taste anything like guacamole LOL. I really did like how smooth and creamy this was (it tasted like it was made with ice cream), so I'm going to try it again with the sweetened condensed milk. This really isn't any different (concept-wise) than zucchini bread or carrot cake, both things I love, so I really think I'd love this as long as it was sweet enough to keep me from thinking of the guacamole again. That being said, I would recommend that avocado lovers try this, even if you're not sure about avocado in a sweet application, because this really is a good recipe for something a little different than the norm.

Other than that, this recipe is delicious and I will be making this for our Thanksgiving with minor modification. | Рейтинг: 4, Рецепт ID: 330876\u001b[0m\n",

I can definitely tell there is great potential here though.  I also think that my chicken breasts were too large and thick so I wish I had pounded them thinner and cut them In half before assembling the dish.  I did this as a make-ahead dinner.  I sprayed my pan with non-stick spray then  mixed the soup and wine together on the bottom of the pan and topped with cheese and chicken before freezing.  Before thawing I popped the food out of the pan (thanks to the non-stick spray) and turned it upside down inside the pan so that the chicken was on the bottom.  I have another one in the freezer and will use the croutons next time. | Рейтинг: 0, Рецепт ID: 25793\u001b[0m\n",

From the moment the chicken went into the pot to sweat, the aroma was incredible.  And once it was in the bowl...   YUM!  DH couldn&#039;t stop saying how good it was.  The only bit of excitement came when I dropped a piece of the raw yucca on the floor (it is SO hard to slice!) and our Rotty nabbed it and ran out the door with it.  All of a sudden it flashed in my mind that raw yucca is toxic.  I finished up putting the yucca in the pot with the chicken and went to google the subject - and found out that yucca needs to be cooked without the toxic root, which is the part down the middle of the yucca. And it was already in the pot!!!  Needless to say, we didn&#039;t waste it and took our chances.  I&#039;m happy to report that we&#039;re all three still alive and kicking...  LOL!

Since I!m not the baker in the family, but my husband is, he has suggested a few tweaks. Persimmon is a very subtle flavor so the taste of persimmon was lost being overpowered by the other strong flavors. My husband suggested cutting the bold flavors like vanilla, allspice, cinnamon, etc in half thereby allowing the persimmon flavors to come through. I will try the recipe again with those changes. Hopefully then they will be able to guess what kind of cake it is. No one who has tasted the cake guessed persimmon as the main ingredient. Like some of the other viewers observation, the baking soda and persimmon created a gel after sitting for a few minutes. I agree, mixing the baking soda with the dry ingredients may avoid that. The cooking time should be about 50 minutes max to prevent dryness in the outer layer. Having said that, the cake was moist on the inside with just enough sweetness( Just enough sugar). I will definitely make it again. Still enjoying what’s left of the cake. Thanks for a great recipe. | Рейтинг: 4, Рецепт ID: 86897\u001b[0m\n",

Double Dutch cocoa was used, 1 tbsp of Splenda Brown for the sugar. Even with the rich cocoa, sugar and chili powder it still tastes like almond butter and not much else, not that there is anything wrong with almond butter. That said, I have only tried it on a spoon right after it was made. I'm going to let it sit and blend for 2/3 days and then try spreading it on some Christmas cookies and I'll update this review at that time. Made for Newest Tag. *EDIT* it's now 4 days later and I have used the almond butter as a filling for Christmas cookies, yumm.

I also used \"petit diced\" Contadina canned tomatoes, so I didn't have to chop. Make sure the onion is cooked quite soft. Forgot to add the garlic and wish I had. I think it would add a lot to the dip. The dip had a pretty rosy-white color. Served with Tostitos Naturals certified organic yellow corn chips. These are large restaurant style chips that are really, really good. The beans added an interesting dimension. This is a great recipe that leaves plenty of room for tweaking. Well done, chef! | Рейтинг: 5, Рецепт ID: 175868\u001b[0m\n",

(He who swears no one can EVER make better meatloaf or lasagna than his mother)  He even commented a couple of times about how great it was and that he went back for seconds.  I did make some changes but nothing too drastic.  I only had lean ground beef so I used that.  I didn't have enough garlic croutons so I toasted some bread and used that to make up the difference.  Someone used up all my thyme (husband) so i used a mix of marjoram and basil, with an extra shake of basil thrown in (I like basil).  I also added one of those small boxes of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed very dry).  I put that in the food processor with the garlic and other veggies.  I did not have any bell peppers so I left that out.  Also, in the sauce, I omitted the cumin, put a few shakes of ground ginger in instead (maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 tsp), and added several dashes more of the hot sauce and worchestershire because I couldn't taste it in the mix.  I baked mine at 350 for 30 minutes, then brushed the sauce on, then I baked it for another 50 minutes and it came out measuring 180 degrees.  I probably could have bumped the heat down, or something for the last round of baking.  Still it didn't seem overcooked.  It was very good. | Рейтинг: 5, Рецепт ID: 157746\n",

Save that texture for white breads and rolls. When I want rye or whole grain, I want hearty. This bread perfectly fits the bill. My husband loves rye, so I make several different versions to change it up. This is the first rye I've made that I personally love and would probably take even over my favorite whole wheat.

I threw in a jar of roasted red peppers and that added some colour and flavour. Sprinkling with grated parmesan also helped with flavour and presentation.

I did make a few changes of my own that I thought added to the flavor for those with the ingredients and inclination.  First, my family are garlic lovers so I increased the amount to 5 cloves (fresh).  We also love onion so I added a small yellow one.  I had some fresh basil and oregano left over from a prior recipe so I added about a teaspoon of each of those.  I couldn&#039;t find ricotta in an 8 oz. portion and didn&#039;t want to waste any so I used 16 oz. of that and 16 oz. of cottage cheese.  Occasionally I also add 4 or 5 finely chopped button mushrooms just for something different.  I&#039;m way lazy when it comes to the noodles and always use &quot;oven ready.&quot;  I can&#039;t tell a difference.

The typical issue with bechamel is that it doesn't have a ton of flavor on its own, and that doesn't change here. Simmering the sauce with some aromatics, like shallots, will help give it some flavor as well as a generous helping of crumbled bacon to help get the flavor through. I also toss in a pinch of grated nutmeg and some cayenne pepper. and make sure to salt and pepper it generously throughout the process. I like to make mine more of like a Mornay (essentially Bechamel with gruyere although no reason to be a purist), by throwing in some grated sharper cheeses and whisking it to combine when I take the sauce off heat. Cheddar, parmesan, gruyere, comte, all work well, but no reason to limit yourself. I'll also note, if it tastes like flour, the flour has been cooked out long enough. The sauce will continue to thicken even after it's taken off the heat, so unless you're using all of it right away, don't wait until the very last moment to pull it off the heat. | Рейтинг: 0, Рецепт ID: 238159\u001b[0m\n",

I made this in one crock pot and a veg pea soup in another crock pot (different recipe). I found the veg one so bland that I ended up adding most of the spices in this recipe to it. The only things I changed with this recipe is that I forgot about the sherry and had to use green lentils as I was out of red. I also added 1 diced carrot. I layered it in the crock pot with peas & lentils on the bottom, followed by veg, then spices and broth/water. Followed what other recipes said and did not stir it, let the crock pot work its magic. Don't be tempted to put in 6 cups of broth, it would be too salty. Next time I would use 3 cups stock and 3 cups water. Of course, it will depend on the type of stock or broth you are using.

I probably should have only gone to 242 degrees (1200 feet altitude) but went to about 245 and when I dipped the apples, the caramel coating came out fairly hard not gooey.  I only dipped 6 medium Granny Smith's so I poured the remainder (about 1/2 a batch) in a dish until firm, then took out and wrapped in plastic and refrigerated. A week later, I wanted to make caramel apples again so I took out my overcooked \"brick\" and hit it once against the counter (while still in plastic) and it shattered.  Then I melted the caramel along with about 1/2 cup milk and 1 Tbsp. butter in the top of a double boiler.  The caramel came out perfect.  I used some Granny Smith's and some Haralson's.  I also rolled them in crushed salted peanuts.  They set up well and tasted great  (although with a bit more dark caramel taste).  So if you mess up, you may be able to correct your mistake.  The next time I would add a little salt to the recipe but otherwise this is a great alternative to unwrapping caramels. | Рейтинг: 5, Рецепт ID: 73274\u001b[0m\n",

The dough was *very * soft and wanted to stick to my hands and the board. I kneaded in a bit more flour to get a workable consistency. After rolling it up, I baked it on a cookie sheet and 35 minutes was perfect in a 400ÂºF convection oven. The result was a loaf with a somewhat biscuit-y texture. We loved the way the olive oil from the pesto soaked into the bread. Perhaps the salt should be reduced or eliminated since both the self-rising flour and pesto already have plenty.  This was a great little treat and quite fun to make.  Thanks for sharing your recipe! | Рейтинг: 5, Рецепт ID: 241001\u001b[0m\n",

Next time, I think I will add a few sprinkles of chili pepper flakes to give it a bit of zip.

I make it often during the winter and of course during Lenten days.  I enjoyed the flavors very much.  I did use ham that I had glazed with maple from our trees, very similar in taste to canadien bacon.  I will use this recipe often over the next few months interchanged with the one I grew up on.

I made this for a small dinner party tonight...........My guests were speechless, and I was smug - as I had already tasted the pie earlier on - 10 stars = TOTALLY DIVINE! I made a few LITTLE subs - no corn syrup, so I used Golden syrup; and I could not get hold of chocolate bits in France, so I threw a few chopped up pieces of 70% chocolate in and sprinkled the finished pie with Belgian cocoa......well why not?! The oats gave this pie such a lovely extra flavour, and the chocolate was a magnificent addition as it added to the complex pecan flavour.

      "\u001b[31mОшибка в отзыве от пользователя 724631: 4.5 stars, this was good and satisfying, but didn't quite make our hearts flutter.  First, I cooked my chicken thighs as part of Recipe #195716 #195716 to save time; the flavoring was perfect for this recipe.  I began cooking the pinto beans according to this recipe; I hadn't planned on 5 hours of soaking/cooking for the pinto beans, so after the 2 hours of soaking, I shifted to a pressure cooker: I poured the beans into the pressure cooker, added water to 2 inches above the beans, and pressure-cooked for 20 minutes; I then added the kosher salt and pressure-cooked for 10 minutes.  Since I had noted very little water left after the 2 hours of soaking,  I decided to drain the pressure-cooked beans and mash about half.  That led to nice, thick refried beans.  (If I had started with the pressure cooker at the beginning, the first round of pressure cooking would have taken only 30 minutes -- that 10 extra minutes would have shaved another 2 hours.) The beans tasted good without the use of oil or lard, a great calorie-saver over canned refried beans.  I did not use MSG, don't trust it.  Note that most pressure-cooker recipes for refried beans would have added the onion to the second pressure cooking round, and many would add 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 diced jalapeno or 2 oz. diced green chilies as well for extra zip.  In this recipe the taco seasoning provided the sole spiciness.  Assembled, the flavors came together as pure comfort food.  We are looking forward to our leftovers.  Thanks for sharing, Ingrid!

That didn't work out, but they were good, tho not what I expected. It was always hard for me to roll a circle with dough, but the filling seemed a bit dry and lots of it fell off the dough, even tho I followed exactly as written. They do look a lot harder to make, than they really are, but my expectations were higher. Sorry that I couldn't give it a higher rating, but they still are a worthy cookie to make and serve to company. I will try them again, and try and figure some way to moisten the filling so that it doesn't fall off. I also think (not sure) that my old recipe called for cream cheese in the dough, which may be the reason why it tasted different from what I expected. Thank you, Karen, for sharing this recipe.  ADDED NOTE:  I was informed by Karen that the reason that some of the filling fell out, was because I did not press it into the dough; something that I will do next time, after librally brushing it with the egg white glaze.

Not bad considering this is simple to make, gourmet in taste and it takes longer to shell the shrimp than it does to cook it LOL   Keys for me are using shrimp that are not shelled/deveined until I am ready to cook them...if you can get fresh...so much the better.  But if you have to buy frozen don't buy the pre-cooked.  I barely sear the shrimp before adding the wine and cream.  Don't want them overcooked and it only takes a couple minutes to get them done.  I then remove the shrimp, fire up the heat to thicken the cream sauce, shut it down and pour it over the shrimp.   I lay down a bed of angle hair pasta or wild rice and then top it with this creamy garlic shimp and people think I am a 5 star chef!

We coveted that bottle, not knowing how to reproduce it! Finally, as we used the last of it, I remembered! Pop always used Julia's book,  \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\". Bless RecipeZaar and the internet! This is delicious on every kind of pork. We rub it on, rub it in, and we don't scrape it off (and no waiting necessary--though Pop left it to rest overnight) I evern put babybacks rubbed with it sealed in foil, in a roast pan, with 1/4--1/2 cup of water, and cook for a few hours at 325( or until the meat falls off the bone). The aroma is incredible! I can't even get them on a plate before word has spread, my son's friends descend on the kitchen,  and all that's left is a heap of bones! The boys know \"Ian's Mom Is Cooking!\" Even though when Pop retired he started cooking and Mom had been cooking for 60 years, he used Mom's recipes and corrected her methods by saying, \"Well, JULIA says to do ...\". I'll never forget our beloved, patient Mom rolling her eyes and laughing, saying, \"That *$#%@ Julia has ruined my life!\" The memories of that well-used book on the table, with post-it notes stuck to the 'good' pages, brought this recipe back to us in the nick of time!

Then, I dipped these in the prepared glaze{I combined the light and dark glaze to make one yummilicious chocolate glaze} and transferred them onto a beautiful transparent heart-shaped serving plate. Next, I sprinkled some thinly sliced almonds over these beautiful little treats and on each I placed a little slice of red or green glazed or maraschino cherry. These looked so good!

This is such a fantastic dessert. It is a denser dessert and very rich and sweet, but the use of dark chocolate mellows it out. For the cake, I never have caster sugar so I just grind up cane sugar, and I haven't noticed any difference. For the berry sauce, I reduce the icing sugar amount drastically and simply combine frozen raspberries and some water. Since the raspberries are tart, it is a perfect compliment to the chocolate.

I subbed sliced baby bellas instead of the button mushrooms because I had them on hand, and I added about 2/3 cup of finely chopped asparagus for the same reason.  I used the evaporated milk.  I forgot the paprika (but will add that next time).  The breadcrumbs I had on hand were garlic panko, which worked well with the other flavors.  I might try a stronger-flavored cheese next time in lieu of the swiss ... possibly a Gruyere?  But overall, a very tasty side dish.  One warning: this quantity of leeks is expensive!

HOWEVER - that could be my tin - maybe US 9 inch tins are a lot deeper?  I had a problem with my oven temperature - so the cake started to brown, I covered it and lowered the temperature - but the centre was still a little wobbly after two hours of cooking!!

For those who said to use less milk, I'm guessing that you didn't cook the milk mixture long enough.  It should be sort of like glue.  If you are gluten-free, this also works with corn starch--try 3 T.  For some reason, while this recipe works, I prefer to put the sugar with the butter and cream for about 8-10 minutes.  The granular sugar will disappear; I like the texture it provides to the frosting.  Last, you can substitute chocolate; I used milk chocolate tonight and it was delicious.  I only used 1 T of cocoa to keep it from getting to dark tasting.  I used 3/4 c sugar, as the recipe says.

I was short on time and decided to try this since the cooking time was only an hour.  I read all the 5 star reviews and noticed that almost everyone has been using the low and slow cook method for this.  That is how I normally always do mine also.  But I figured, what the heck, lets go exactly by the recipe and see how they turn out.  After cooking an hour, I noticed the sauce was runny and wasnt sticking to the ribs.  So I uncovered and cooked another 30 min. to thicken and give the ribs a nice crust.  The ribs werent as tender as we like them.  I was afraid of this, but they was still edible.  We also didnt care for the sauce.  For us there was too much honey in it that it overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  Overall I have to give the original recipe 3 stars.  I deducted 1 for not caring for the sauce, and another 1 for the cooking method.  Like many others, if you do the low and slow method, this would definitely have been a 4 star for us.

I prepared by making sure I was dressed to get messy and that was all.  I bought some tomatoes this morning at a local farmers market in Kent, OH.  I added a bit more basil because I'm a fanatic,and a tbsp of chopped oregano...I also added a 1/4 cup of red wine to the onion, basil, garlic and oregano after it was done cooking and reduced it down by half before adding the tomatoes.  I didn't find it to be too thing.  I think this was because I let it simmer for 1 1/2 hours and then put it in my blender to puree.  Then I just put it back on the stove for another half hour.  I think if you have trouble with it being too thin, before you add tomatoe paste, try blending it a bit.  Also, when you cho the tomatoes try putting them in a colander to drain just a bit before adding them to the pot.  This is what I did.  Also, I saw a recipe on another site that says you can place tomatoes in boiling water for 2 mins and then blanch in cold water to make peeling easier.

I also enjoyed that the lack of spicing meant that the actual ingredients were able to shine on their own.  Myself and my husband have different heat tolerance levels.  So, he put hot and spicy jalapenos on his and I put mild banana chillies. I served the steak in flour tortillas with salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Thank you for a tasty meal.

      "\u001b[31mОшибка в отзыве от пользователя 593927: Totally 5 stars!!! I love to combine this with recipe#422807 for wonderful skin. I also like to add freshly grated ginger for tummy aches or two garlic chunks for colds. (I take the garlic out after 4 minutes) This tastes very good and definitely has benefits for the look of the skin over time as it cleans the liver. Like other reviewers I feel a need to stress the importance of using a good quality local organic honey, ie not from the regular grocers! The best honey is local to wherever we live  because it helps with allergies and organic without additives. I do add more honey per preference and leave about 10 minutes with a small plate over top to keep hot and I find it has more lemon flavour which we like. I was originally debating 4 stars because I had a regular non-local honey to use. I find it doesn't taste as good as the local organic ones and more than once I felt it gives me a slight allergic reaction (non-local honey that is). Also the quality of water used is important as well. City treated water with tons of chemicals and hormones is a NO-NO for your health. I had used distilled water and would have preferred spring water. Since then I only use spring water. I never use a 1 inch slice of lemon as that is too thick. I tried it that way and it wasn't as good plus it wastes the lemon. I use about 1/4 inch slice. Oh and don't forget to wash the lemon before cutting it. A definite make over and over drink.

My grocery store did not have ripened anaheim chilies (red) so I used the green anaheim chilies instead. I also cut the recipe in half as it's just 3 of us & depending on how hot it is, it may be just me eating it. lol It's currently in a jar in the refrigerator but was super easy to make (I never would have thought it was!) & the house smelled amazing. The entire place smelled like peppers while the mixture was cooling on the stove. I taste-tested the sauce after straining last night & it's not as fiery hot as I'd expected, the vinegar & salt are quite pronounced. I suspect that after aging these flavors will balanace out & probably swap places in intensity. I expect it to get hotter & less salty & vinegary. I'm really excited to try it. :) Thanks for posting, alli! Made for ZWT5 - Ali Baba's Babes._x000D_\n",
      "UPDATE:  OMG!  My expectations for this recipe were right on.  It's been 2 weeks & 2 days in the fridge & the flavor is spicy hot without the salt/vinegar flavors that were so prominent when first made.  The surprising (& maybe strange) thing is that if I were blindfolded & asked what kind of pepper was in this recipe I would tell you without a doubt that it's jalapeno.  But there is no jalapeno in the recipe at all.  When I taste-tested this (with just a finger) two days ago, I knew that it was going to be way too hot for my boys to eat.  So I had to wait til today when DS was out all day with friends & DH was planning on making (gag) frozen pizza for lunch.  lol  So today I enjoyed a ham & cheese-filled tortilla with sour cream and raspberry/chipotle salsa on the side.  As my toddler would say (a la Barney), \"Super-dee-duper!\"  I can't wait to try this with the red peppers too.  DH even looked for them at the store for me.

I was looking and looking for a \"good\" moist and sweet cornbread recipe and had the hardest time finding it and ultimately thought I couldn't because I was not looking for a vegan recipe.  3 years ago I needed to make a vegan cornbread for our vegan friends and I came across this recipe.  I have made this over and over and over again- no one can tell it is vegan-- so, it is the cornbread I make for my entire family and all friends whether vegan or not!<br/><br/>You can use cow's milk- when I did I used 2% or Fat free.  But honestly it tastes better with the Soy. I have added frozen corn and even pickled jalapenos and it always turns out great!  I may try reducing the syrup in the future to give it a less sweet and more savory taste- but that may upset all who I make this for :) <br/><br/>I just bought new double ovens and found that 35 minutes is a bit too long in the oven and I actually cooked them last night at 350 for 25 minutes (conventional not convection).  They were very moist and of course very sweet and make a great breakfast the next day!<br/><br/>The reason I post this review now (3 years later) is because last night I lost the printed recipe and went to look for it again online and came across it twice on Food.com (I thought this was funny).  It just has a different name, Moist Vegan Cornbread.  It is the EXACT same recipe and does not give credit to Candace & Amy at the Vegan Lunch Box (which I appreciate this one did).

I found it very easy to make -- did the tomato mixture up about an hour ahead of time and then it came together in a few minutes when we were ready to eat. It's very important to deseed the tomatoes, even after doing that I was surprised how liquidy the mixture could be after it sat for a while. But I didn't find it made the bread soggy -- toasting the bread ahead of time certainly helped with keeping it nice and crisp and also, you can just scoop the tomato mixture out and leave most of the juices behind. The only thing I found confusing was how much cheese to use. I wasn't sure if it should be 1/4 cup of each cheese or 1/4 cup total. And how big a baguette? I used a small loaf (demi-baguette size) of ciabattia bread, but if you were using a larger loaf you'd need more of the tomato mixture, I think.

This won't matter once you cut up the meat and throw the sauce over it BUT if you're planning on serving this without the sauce, it won't be as good. <br/>--I had to move the sauce to the stove top to get it to boil and thicken.

I am not sure if the top is supposed to be golden brown and resemble a cookie, but mine did and the inside was very moist.  I pulled them out at 1 hour and 10 minutes as I was afraid I had over cooked them (being smaller).  Crust was done and they seemed fone - I just envisioned a custard pie but never having had a buttermilk pie before this may be exactly what it was supposed to be - I don't know.  ;)  Taste was wonderful - everyone ate it for dessert (Easter) and loved it - but just FYI - it will serve quite a few as it is RICH and decadent!!!

But I can&#039;t get over my &quot;how hard can it be&quot; spirit! So, I tried making this substituting coconut sugar for the regular sugar. It&#039;s supposed to be healthier! And it says it can be used as a 1:1 substitute in recipes! So, guess what? my jelly didn&#039;t jell! And, the coconut sugar made it turn a rather darkish brown. But, it tastes great! So, maybe it&#039;s a good sweetener for tea?  Like many have said, it has a flavor like a strong honey. I found the process of pulling out all the petals from the green ends labor intensive.But dandelions are so plentiful I would maybe try this again if there&#039;s a way to do it with an alternative to sugar. Any one tried using agave?

It still did not seem well-mixed when done, so I took it out of the ABM,  kneaded it on my counter & left it to rise ~ but it did not seem to rise easily, so I encouraged it in a 100F oven for a cpl of min & that worked well. I let it rest to finish rising, oven-baked the bread & all was well.

This is a myth that keeps getting perpetuated and was debunked countless times, most famously on Cooks Illustrated: &quot;Letting steaks sit at room temperature before cooking does not raise their temperature enough to prevent a band of gray meat from developing below the crust.&quot; If you want uniformity, it is better to perform the reverse sear method, which is essentially the exact opposite of the method described in this article. You start the meat in a low temperature oven first, with a thermometer. Bring it up to about 118 degrees F and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, the meat will continue to cook about 2 to 3 degrees after you have taken it out. The final step should be searing 2-3 minutes on the hottest your pan can handle and then finally another 10 minutes of rest. You will have the juiciest, perfectly cooked medium rare steak with a nice crust. | Рейтинг: 2, Рецепт ID: 354979\u001b[0m\n",

Meat was cooked until it shredded.  We did not mix the sauce and meat with the vegetables other than onion and diced tomatoes until just before finishing the pot.  The sauce was thickened slightly before adding the already cooked veggies and after pulling out the celery stalks.   Potatoes and hunks of carrot were cooked separately and added at the end of the cooking cycle.  Diced tomatoes and onions were added to the meat broth/sauce about ten minutes before thickening.  We put celery stalks in the meat broth as it cooked and then fished them out.  As for the rest of the vegetables, we used whatever was handy or left over from corn, to beans, to okra.  Every cook had their own little twist.  We didn&#039;t use Worcheshire or bay leaf.  In our neck of the woods, and when we had it, we used African Chicken Peri-Peri spice to the cook&#039;s taste and a lid full of vinegar if we found it too sweet tasting.  Our meats were a mixture of leftovers, and usually just chicken and pork.  The whole idea of Brunswick Stew is to use your leftovers to make it as far as I can remember.

Use the same amount of tenderloins as bacon strips. I used 14, which was the same amount as one standard package of bacon. Cut each bacon strip in half and wrap each half over each side of each tenderloin, leaving a gap between the bacon halves. This allows you to cut the chicken in the center with a fork and have a half strip of bacon in every bite. Cook on a pan at 350 for 30 min then take out and turn the over off. Sprinkle chedder cheese over each tenderloin and put back into the oven for 5 min. Don&#039;t turn the oven back on for the remaining 5 minutes. I served it with cottage cheese and avacado.

They would be covered with a very hardcoat of salt (like this), they bring it to the table and break it off.  You would think that you would choke from the salt taste.  That's what's so neat, it doesn't have one.  I have never prepared prime rib at home, and this is a pretty easy way to do it.  I have the problem of husband preferring medium, I like rare.  So, I pulled it out at about 135, apparently, it continues to cook while it sits.  It came out a perfect medium rare, so tender and tasty.  Nice compromise.  I may add some spices (maybe a Jamaican Jerk blend)around the fat edges before covering it with salt the next time, just for kicks.  Putting the salt on is kind of like packing snow on, kind of wierd, but it works and speeds up the cooking time without sacrificing tenderness.

The prob w/giving in to the urge for this comfort food is the frying part. I was attracted to the flavor profile &amp; the fact it was more baked then fried. It is such an easy-fix &amp; was made exactly as written except for the use of 3 skinless &amp; boneless chicken breasts. 1 was quite lrg &amp; cut into medallions. The other 2 were split &amp; made 2 lrg chicken tenders each. My only fear was that the breast meat would be dry, but that would have been my bad if it happened.

The substitution of the mustard was because I forgot to buy dried mustard and the missing nuts and raisins were I'm an air head and was eating when it dawned on me the nuts were missing. This week made as written not forgetting anything or making any substitutions and it was tasty but not as good. We decided the reason it was better the first time was because the yellow prepared mustard allowed the chutney to shine better then the powdered mustard did. Another big difference was last weeks spinach was younger and more tender then this weeks, thus having a milder flavor last week. All that said loved the chutney dressing made with prepared mustard and am planning on taking this salad to an up coming pot luck as it is very pretty and very tasty.

We lived in Louisiana ....she died in 1964 and I don't think I have thought about this since then.  Same ingredience but she would let the butter get soft and with a wooden spoon or a mixer whip the two together. If you are a child making it,  beating it with a spoon takes up a lot of time and I am sure I did it that way  for that reason. Then she would get the mixer out and make it smoother. Or if she had powdered sugar I could do it all be myself with just a spoon. You really need  soft white bread for the best effect.

Cooked it on low in the crockpot for 4 hours and then turned it on the keep warm setting for the party. It made 32 generous sandwiches making it this way plus enough for those who didn't want to eat it on a bun. All that was left at the end of the night was the sauce!

My family gets competitive with perfecting banana bread, no bakery or restaurant has even come close to comparing. But this is perfection. I did some things differently.

No lie) and I was looking for an easy yet creative way to cook.  I cut the lemon up a little smaller than apple and onion pieces and used about twice as much chives, two apples, one onion, 1 tsp salt and half tsp pepper with olive oil. Lined glass dish with foil that hung out over edge of pan to fold back over fish. I did not individually wrap. Baked for 45 mins. Wow!  I made a basalmic and pure maple syrup reduction.  Slid the fish on platter, removed skin, from top side, and drizzled a little of this reduction on the exposed top of fish. Smashing! The fish looked beautiful!

I did not have the simsim, refused to use my black seed in a recipe that i hadnt tried before, was conservative with my eggs, and did not have fine semolina. Instead of the fine semolina I used coarse semolina and only used about a cup of it and substituted the rest in all purpose white flour. Also, I only used the one egg for the actual bread and not the multiple yolks for the browning. HOWEVER, my results were very very good. I got a nice round loaf of bread that was nice and soft in the middle, a crispy on the outside. The loaf browned very well without the egg yolk wash, and had a nice tan color. The bread is nice and sturdy, so for those who aren't accustomed to a good ole pain de maison, don't expect Wonder bread. It is a sturdy bread for soaking up and eating other foods, almost acting as its own kind of utensil. <br/><br/>PS. I really love Um Safia's recipes!

It can be VERY VERY difficult to find authentic Algerian recipes. I really appreciate when she provides information on the regions that foods come from, because it makes a big difference when you think you are doing something really cool like making tli tli (which is often eaten in the eastern part of the country) to surprise your western Algerian husband and he looks at you like, what the crap is this?

I grabbed the pan as I was rushing out the door to go to work, so I forgot about sprinkling it with the powdered sugar. I thought it looked a little plain naked, so I went for desperation measures: I stopped at Mobil-on-The-Run near work and picked up a can of vanilla frosting so I could nuke-and-drizzle when I got to work (the store had powdered sugar, but I wouldn't have had anything to sift it with at work).

I made this for a friend who is allergic to peanuts and just about every other food in the world and he was about ready to propose marriage!  When I make it I use waay more onions, and about equal amounts, volume wise of onions, peppers, and tomatoes.  My husband and I go on a marathon of chopping, we set up 4! frying pans to start the onions and green peppers toasting with the overhead fan going full blast.  We deglaze each pan with Sutter Home wine (just a spash in each) because we prefer regular pans to get some nice fast browning on the onions which means, you must deglaze.  If you use nonstick pans, it will take you forever to brown the onions slightly.  Anyway,  we take a tiny break and wipe our eyes while the onions start to heat up, then chop the tomatoes and the rest of the peppers.  Put the peppers in a stockpot with a drop of oil and the lid on so they steam cook.  Add the onions and tomatoes to the stockpot, add any spices, and let it bubble slowly for at least 2 hours.  When everything is nice and soft, we crush the veggies against the side of the pot with a slotted spoon (metal spoon) to thicken the stew.  At this point we bring the temperature all the way up to a bubble again (if needed) and add chopped (not crushed) garlic cloves (for 3/4 of a stockpot, we add about 12 cloves), then immediately turn off the heat and remove the stockpot to a different burner because we have an electric stove.  The garlic shouldn&#039;t be cooked to death.  Bay leaf and marjoram are allowable herbs in this dish, but many people leave them out.  I like to use andhouille sausage if I can&#039;t get real kolbasz, but you can find lots of Euro markets that carry hungarian kolbasz these days if you look.  My mother used polish keilbasa and it was fine.  We also added a bit of cooked rice at home.  I now add cooked brown rice and it&#039;s still just as good.  There are other allowable adjuncts to the dish:  eggs, ham, crutons, etc.  Experiment and find something you like.  Letcho is also an ingredient in many Hungarian dishes.  It&#039;s always best to use fresh peopers and tomatoes, but in the winter, when you couldn&#039;t get it, canned letcho was used instead.  Then it became a traditional additive.

This was ready for me, at about 15 mins. prior to the 4 hour mark, so I turned it to high for that 15 mins & thickened the sauce with some cornstartch, as it was still pretty soupy. And I personally prefer a thicker sauce. While the chicken turned out great,(it was falling apart), during my first few bites I was trying to figure out what it was missing. I then asked my husband if he liked it and he said, no, not really,it's bland. Although we did not salt & pepper it on our plates, I just sprinkled it with the parsley,(which did look nice.) I was quite surprised with the results,as usually Campbells recipes are pretty tasty.I think they may need to go back to the drawing board for this one, sorry.

Try Self Rising Flour which is made from soft wheat and the brands have been around for years. It contains all one needs to make biscuit, pancakes, waffle and on and on. Just add cold butter or in some cases a good frozen lard, cheese of choice, buttermilk which I do not stock much as most called butter milk is not real butter milk, but sort of a factory made stuff. I use a good home made or purchase sour cream or even better yogurt. Nice cheddar cheese or maybe a good blend of 5 cheese. No need for added salt or baking powder.

I did make a few substitutions though, because of ingredients I had on hand....or didn't have.  No fresh red onions, so I just used dried.  By time they sat in the dressing, they had softened up nicely.  I also changed the cheese.  I have these 'sting cheese' sticks that keep falling on the floor every time you open the door.  Time for those suckers to hit the road, so that's what went into the salad.  I also didn't have water chestnuts.  Too bad, cause I love the crunch.  Instead, I used diced dates.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I did however need to take some drastic action because I didn't bargain on the difference a small substitution would make. I can't get peppermint Extract here, but did have some imported peppermint ESSENCE... First I added the recommended 1 Tablespoon, and couldn't taste the peppermint at all and needed to add another two tablesppons to make this taste pepperminty enough. The result of this was a very liquid mixture with the condensed milk so I needed an additional two and a half cups of icing sugar to make it anywhere near a firm dough form. After that I used a small wine bottle top to press out the circles and it made zillions of them LOL... Mine turned out small and fatter and extactly bite sized. I dried them overnight under a clean tea towel after drying them for 2 hours  and turning them over, and the next morning they dipped like a dream... considering I'm a messy dipper LOL. If you are using ESSENCE instead of Extract I would *strongly recommend* not using the entire amount of the 14oz condensed milk to compensate for the extra liquid that the essence will make, or halve the recipe becuase I got at least 90 of my small ones from only *half* the mixture I ended up having. Guess what are the Birthday Treats Bags? LOL. That said, I would make these again in heartbeat, they are so well received and people here were amazed that I made them myself and the recipe was demanded several times.

All my adult life I've been trying to make \"Chicken Fried\" anything, with less than satisfactory results. Why? Because the coating would fall or peel off during cooking, either just slipping off, or sticking to the pan and being pulled off. I have followed your recipe twice, now, with excellent results. The only changes I made were to season the flour with some onion powder and smoked paprika as well as the salt and pepper. I think the secret is letting the pounded, egged, and flour-coated meat sit on the racks for the 15 minutes before placing in the hot oil. (the last time I made it, it sat a little over 30 minutes.) The coating did not stick or want to slip off. It stayed married to the meat, thickened slightly, and became golden brown with a nice crunch to the bite upon eating.

D1 dough tasted flat, too starchy (potato-ey), and dense, while D2 proved to be fluffly, easier to worok with, and simply--just right.  Oh, and I also replaced the brown sugar with honey powder (found in Korean markets), and before closing up my dough ball, I would squeeze a dollop of honey over the honey powder so to help speed up the melting process for the syrup formation.  Adding even just a bit of syrup over your brown sugar will help!  :)  Awesome, awesome recipe!  I just made more last night, to enjoy after tonight's dinner.  ^.^  yipee~_x000D_\n",

On the skillet, I lay the round ball atop a layer of hot oil, and after about 15-30 sec., I flip it over and THEN flatten as much as possible.

I like to add mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe!

It was very bland, dense and a little chewy. There are too many variables left open in the recipe, I think. The title of the recipe is \"Hot Chocolate Cake\" yet the ingredients state to use prepared hot cocoa - hot chocolate and hot cocoa are two different things. All I had at the time was instant hot chocolate mix so that's what I used. And that too leaves a lot of variables to consider - marshmallows or plain, should it be made with water, or milk, or a bit of both water and milk? I used mix with marshmallows as that was all I had, and prepared it with just water. I baked this up in two 8-inch round pans as upon pouring the batter into one pan it was nearly full; I expected the cake to rise a good bit and so got out my second pan for half the batter. The cake did not rise much at all. It also stuck to the pans; I think greased and floured pans would have been better than lightly greased pans.

Then I lightly dusted both sides with flour, and rolled it out on a floured surface and dusted the pin as well. I would get it to an egg shape, then turn 1/2 way and flip and roll again the other way until they were as flat as they would get (which is nicely thin).

      "Отзыв от пользователя 186855: A very pretty tart, and quite easy to make. I cheated and used frozen tart shells, as that's what I had on hand. I found the onion/balsamic mixture very prominent, and smothered the delicate mushrooms and the cheese mixture. Possibly my onion was larger than the chef's. For our tastes, next time I'll either reduce or omit the vinegar and reduce the total amount of onions. I'd also increase the amount of mushrooms and cheese sauce. That part I thought was amazing!!!

Since no one in my family is big on cooked spinach, I added it raw in our bowls and spooned the chicken and beans over the top to slightly wilt it.

The taste was thru the roof- easily 10 stars, but my omelette made as directed got way more browned than I normally would like. After beating the egg whites to stiff peaks and folding in the yolk mixture I could not pour the mixture into my pan but rather spread it in. I used 1 tbsp of butter as I didn't see it in the directions and I thought that was a pretty standard amount. I used medium low-medium heat and had to cover the pan as the bottom was cooking so fast and the top not yet done. I couldn't spread the mascarpone mixture because the top was so delicate but rather plopped it on in small spoonfuls. I too added a bit more cheddar and have to say that despite what I feel was overcooked probably one of the best tasting omelettes I have ever eaten. I will perfect this technique for my needs and make again very soon. Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT5 Omelette Challenge. eta: I made this again and while it still was very brown, the flavor was as spectacular as the first time I made it!
